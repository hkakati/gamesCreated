How the Game Works

- You play multiple rounds against the computer.
- Each round, you and the computer choose one of Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- The winner is decided based on the standard rules:
  - Rock beats Scissors
  - Scissors beats Paper
  - Paper beats Rock
- The final winner is declared based on who wins more rounds.
- If there's a tie, tie-breaker rounds continue until one wins.
